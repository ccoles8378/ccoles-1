<h1>Hello, world! My name is Caelan.
</h1>
<p>This is a webpage all about me. My likes, dislikes, hopes, dreams, and favorite things.</p>
<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>I am a sophmore in high school, and my favorite subject is science. I live with my mom and dad,  and my brother is a freshman in college. I love traveling with my family and hope to visit all fifty states. I listen to a lot of music and like to make art. I consider myself a dog person, although I also love cats.  I have a 4-year old cat named Echo.</p>
<p>In my spare time I like to listen to music, hang out with friends, sleep, bake, and of course, play with my cat. My life goal is to travel the world.</p>
